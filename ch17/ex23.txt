Wikipedia has an excellent article on hash tables and implmenetation
strategies:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table

A chaining hash table's performance degrades gracefully when the load becomes
heavy. If lookup and insertion performance are paramount, this is probably an
optimal strategy. The hash table can still be ineffective if the hash
algorithm is poor; for example, if most of the elements get inserted into a
small number of chains, the search time can approach O(N).

The space overhead with this approach is associated with the additional
storage required for the linked list for each chain. To improve lookup time
further when multiple elements live in a chain, the hash table size can be
further increased, assuming the hash algorithm was chosen well enough to keep
spreading things out.

To even further improve performance at the cost of space, some implementations
store more than one element in a chain node. This allows them to be better
cached, but increases space overhead when those slots are not filled.

An alternative strategy does away with the linked list and stores all elements
in the hash table itself. This requires less space, but can increase lookup
times because the hash table must locate an element by jumping around the hash
table in a deterministic pattern looking for the element (or an unused space).
This can get especially bad when the table is heavily loaded because
collisions become more frequent (the lookup process may have to evaluate and
skip entries that do not even belong to the given key.)

According to wikipedia, the performance is severely degraded when the load
factor grows beyond 0.7 or so. Even a "perfect" hash algorithm will begin to
break down in this way. A more aggressive resize algorithm is required, which
may further slow down lookups because of more frequent resizing.

There are many more algorithms, some which combine the two approaches to get
the benefit of both.
