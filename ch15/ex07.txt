These are the C++ keywords I was able to think of without using a reference. I consider
only standard C++ keywords (no extensions) and I do not include preprocessor directives.

new (includes new[])
delete (includes delete[])
virtual
static
auto (not used until C++0x)
class
struct
enum
public
private
protected
volatile
explicit
extern
export
template
using (includes using namespace)
namespace
const
this
operator

return
if
for
else
goto
while
do
try
catch
case
switch
continue
break

typeid
typename
sizeof
static_cast
dynamic_cast
reinterpret_cast
const_cast

signed
unsigned
void
int
float
double
long
char
bool
true
false
short

Here are the keywords I missed:
friend
default
inline
mutable
register
typedef
union
wchar_t

You can tell which keywords I have used the least!
